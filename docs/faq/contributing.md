# FAQ: Contributing

## How can I contribute?

We welcome any and all kinds of contribution, including:

 * bug fixes and code contributions

You are free to make PRs on any LinkML repo, including:

Be sure to read the CONTRIBUTING.md for the repo you wish to contribute to.

For filing new issues, we prefer you to use the [main linkml repo](https://github.com/linkml/linkml/issues).

You may wish to browse the list of [good first issues](https://github.com/linkml/linkml/labels/good%20first%20issue)

## How do I stay involved?

We have a Slack channel for the core team and adopters of bleeding edge new features - [join here](https://join.slack.com/t/obo-communitygroup/shared_invite/zt-1oq48ttk7-kKo0i6TwntYtAq~Jcjjg4g).

## How do I register my schema?

You can make a GitHub Pull Request (PR) on the main [linkml-registry](https://linkml.io/linkml-registry/home/) metadata file.

If you are not familiar with the process of making PRs via the GitHub interface, you may find the [guide to registering OBO ontologies](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-registry/blob/main/models.yaml) useful (of course, LinkML schemas are not OBO ontologies, but the process is analogous).
