## How do I stay involved?

See [Get Involved](https://linkml.io/linkml/get-involved/index.html) for more information on how to get involved with the LinkML community.


## How do I register my schema?

You can make a GitHub Pull Request (PR) on the main [linkml-registry](https://linkml.io/linkml-registry/) metadata file.

If you are not familiar with the process of making PRs via the GitHub interface, you may find the [guide to registering OBO ontologies](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-registry/blob/main/linkml_registry.yaml) useful (of course, LinkML schemas are not OBO ontologies, but the process is analogous).
