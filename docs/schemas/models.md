# Models

A LinkML model describes the structure of your data. Your data can be
expressed as JSON or YAML files (the default form for LinkML), or as
CSVs, or as a relational database, or even a triplestore or graph
database.

LinkML models are authored as YAML files. These files can be understood as data files that instantiate [SchemaDefinitions](https://w3id.org/linkml/SchemaDefinition) in the LinkML metamodel.

The overall layout of a schema yaml file is roughly as follows:

```yaml
id: https://example.org/my-schema
name: my_schema
<OTHER METADATA HERE>

# classes are the main organization until for data;
# all data records instantiate a class
classes:
  Person:
    ...
  Organization:
    ...

# data fields get their own section
slots:
  name:
   ...
  email:
   ...
  age:
   ...

# optional: schema type extensions
types:
  AgeType:
   ...

# enumerations
enums:
  GenderType:
   ...
```

To illustrate we will use an example schema for modeling people and attributes about people. The full schema can be found in this repo at [examples/PersonSchema](https://github.com/linkml/linkml/tree/main/examples/PersonSchema)

## Model metadata and directives

A LinkML model/schema may have various pieces of metadata associated with it, for example:

```yaml
id: https://w3id.org/linkml/examples/personinfo
name: personinfo
description: |-
  Information about people, based on [schema.org](http://schema.org)
license: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/
default_curi_maps:
  - semweb_context
imports:
  - linkml:types
prefixes:
  personinfo: https://w3id.org/linkml/examples/personinfo/
  linkml: https://w3id.org/linkml/
  schema: http://schema.org/
  rdfs: http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#
  prov: http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#
default_prefix: personinfo
default_range: string
...
```

 * names, identifiers, and metadata
     * [id](https://w3id.org/linkml/id) -- the unique identifier for the schema, as a IRI
     * [name](https://w3id.org/linkml/name) -- the schema name. Use only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and dashes
     * [description](https://w3id.org/linkml/description) -- a summary of the schema. Can include markdown formatting
     * [license](https://w3id.org/linkml/license) -- CC0 recommended
 * modules
     * [imports](https://w3id.org/linkml/imports) -- allows for modular development. See [imports](imports)
 * prefix management
     * [prefixes](https://w3id.org/linkml/prefixes) -- A map of prefixes. See [prefixes](prefixes)
     * [default_prefixes](https://w3id.org/linkml/default_prefix) -- The prefix used for all elements in this schema
     * [default_curi_maps](https://w3id.org/linkml/default_curi_maps) -- prefix maps from prefixcommons

## Classes

Classes provide templates for organizing data. Data objects should
instantiate classes in the schema. Each class has a set of *slots*
(aka fields, attributes) that are applicable to it.

Classes operate in a very similar way to classes in a programming
language like Python or Java. They are analogous to tables in
relational databases.

Classes are defined in a `classes` block at the top level of your YAML, where the key is the class name:

```yaml
classes:
  Person:
    is_a: NamedThing
    description: >-
      A person (alive, dead, undead, or fictional).
    class_uri: schema:Person
    mixins:
      - HasAliases
    slots:
      - primary_email
      - birth_date
      - age_in_years
      - gender
      - has_employment_history
      - has_familial_relationships
      - has_medical_history
```

See [ClassDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/ClassDefinition) for a full list of allowed slots

**Note**: class names can be normal natural language noun phrases
encompassing characters such as spaces. However, when converted to
external representations, different rules will be applied, and
typically the exported name is in PascalCase. So for example, you
could call your class `named thing`, but the URI for the class would
be `myprefix:NamedThing`


Because LinkML is described in LinkML, your schema is an
instantiation of the LinkML metamodel, and schema elements have a list
of allowed slots. So for example, `is_a`, `description`, and `slots`
are all slots that are applicable to instances of
ClassDefinitions.

This is a little meta at first but you get used to it!


## Slots

Slots (aka attributes, fields, columns, properties) can be associated
with classes to specify what fields instances of that class can have

For example, in the schema above, instances of Person classes can have
values for primary email, birthdate, etc.

In LinkML slots are "first class" and are defined independently of
classes, and a slot can be used in any number of classes.

Slots are defined in a `slots` block at the top level of your YAML:

```yaml
slots:
  id:
    identifier: true
    slot_uri: schema:identifier
  name:
    slot_uri: schema:name
  gender:
    slot_uri: schema:gender
    range: gender_enum
  age_in_years:
    range: integer
    minimum_value: 0
    maximum_value: 999
  has_employment_history:
    range: EmploymentEvent
    multivalued: true
    inlined_as_list: true
  current_address:
    range: Address
```

You can then re-use these in your class definitions. For example, if your `Person` class has a `name` slot, just list it:

```yaml
classes:
  Person:
    ...
    slots:
      - ...
      - name
      - ...
```

Note that LinkML models are "closed" by default. If a slot is not listed for a class, then data that includes an unlisted slot will be invalid.

Slots are [inherited](inheritance), so for example if `name` is listed
as an allowed slot for `NamedThing`, and `Person` inherits from
NamedThing, then `name` will be valid for Person. There is no need to
re-declare

See [SlotDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/SlotDefinition) for a full list of which metamodel slots can be applied to slots.

### The Attribute slot

As a convenience feature, you can specify slot definitions directly within a class using the `attributes` slot:

```yaml
classes:
  Person:
    is_a: NamedThing
    description: >-
      A person (alive, dead, undead, or fictional).
    class_uri: schema:Person
    mixins:
      - HasAliases
    attributes:
      gender:
        slot_uri: schema:gender
        range: gender_enum
      age_in_years:
        range: integer
        minimum_value: 0
        maximum_value: 999
```

## Types

See [TypeDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/TypeDefinition) in the metamodel.

Types in LinkML are scalar data values such as strings, integers, floats, and so on. LinkML comes with its own set of types, and these can be extended.

For example, you may represent chemical formulae as strings in your model, but if you provide an explicit type that maps to string, it makes the intended meaning clearer, and different applications can operate on these differently:

```yaml
  chemical formula value:
    uri: xsd:string
    base: str
    description: A chemical formula
```

## Enums

The core enumeration model is the same as for familiar systems, where there is a set of allowed string values:


```yaml
enums:
  FamilialRelationshipType:
    permissible_values:
      SIBLING_OF:
      PARENT_OF:
      CHILD_OF:
```

You can also make your enums into a ticher controlled vocabulary, with definitions built in:

```yaml
enums:
  FamilialRelationshipType:
    permissible_values:
      SIBLING OF:
        description: A family relationship where the two members have a parent on common
      PARENT OF:
        description: A family relationship between offspring and their parent
      CHILD OF:
        description: inverse of the PARENT_OF relationship
```

(note you can include spaces in your enums if you like)

LinkML goes beyond most frameworks and allows your enums to be backed by external ontologies. For example, this enum is backed by [GSSO](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/gsso)

```yaml

prefixes:
  GGSO: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GSSO_

enums:
  GenderType:
    permissible_values:
      nonbinary man:
        meaning: GSSO:009254
      nonbinary woman:
        meaning: GSSO:009253
      transgender woman:
        meaning: GSSO:000384
      transgender man:
        meaning: GSSO:000372
      cisgender man:
        meaning: GSSO:000371
      cisgender woman:
        meaning: GSSO:000385
```

## Subsets

Elements of a schema can be partitioned into named [subsets](https://w3id.org/linkml/SubsetDefinition). These have no semantic meaning, but they can be useful for tagging parts of a schema for different purposes.

## Metamodel

The LinkML *metamodel* describes LinkML itself. All LinkML schemas
instantiate the [subsets](https://w3id.org/linkml/SchemaDefinition)
class in the metamodel, and all elements of a schema instantiate other
metamodel classes.

All metamodel elements are in the [https://w3id.org/linkml/](https://w3id.org/linkml/) namespace, e.g:

 * [https://w3id.org/linkml/SchemaDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/SchemaDefinition)
 * [https://w3id.org/linkml/ClassDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/ClassDefinition)
 * [https://w3id.org/linkml/SlotDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/SlotDefinition)
 * [https://w3id.org/linkml/EnumDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/EnumDefinition)
