Generators
==========

A LinkML *generator* is code that transforms a linkml schema into a
datamodel expressed using another framework, or into some other
artefact, such as JSON-Schema, or markdown documentation.

Generators allow you to tap into the rich tooling offered in other
technical stacks. The philosophy of LinkML is to embrace and reuse
these existing frameworks, rather than serve as an alternative.

Schema Frameworks
-----------------

These generators translate from a LinkML model to commonly used web
standards for structuring data such as JSON-Schema, Protocol Buffers
(ProtoBuf), and GraphQL.

Linked Data Standards
---------------------

`Linked Data <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data>_` is a broad
term encompassing frameworks based on RDF and URIs/IRIs. LinkML
schemas, can be translated directly into RDF, or they can be mapped to
OWL, or translated to shape languages such as ShEx and SHACL.

Documentation Generation
------------------------

These generators will translate LinkML models into documentation,
including UML class diagrams and markdown websites that can be easily
published on static hosting sites.

Language Specific
-----------------

These will generate object models that are particular to specific
languages such as Python, Javascript, or Java.
