# CLI

The CLI interface to LinkML is currently divided into two styles:
- One combined cli underneath [`linkml`](./linkml.md)
  - [`linkml generate`](./generate.md)
  - [`linkml lint`](./lint.md)
  - [`linkml validate`](./validate.md)
- Many independent entrypoints for each generator or tool, see [Entrypoints](./entrypoints.md)
