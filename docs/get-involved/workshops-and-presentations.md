November 5, 2025 <br>
16th International Conference on Biological and Biomedical Ontology (ICBO 2025) <br>
Hosted by Sierra Moxon, Corey Cox, and Kevin Schaper

This workshop provides an introduction to LinkML aimed at people who generate or work with scientific data. It includes hands-on sessions to help participants learn how to:

- Set up a LinkML schema repository locally
- Understand how ontologies are used in LinkML
- Integrate ontologies into LinkML models, focusing on creating controlled vocabularies, mappings, and enumerations based on existing ontologies
- Validate data against LinkML schemas
