# Quick Install Guide

There are multiple ways to installing LinkML.

## Local installation: Use the Python package

If you are developing locally you can install LinkML as a python package in your local environment.

### Install Python

Get the latest version of Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/ or with your operating systemâ€™s package manager.

You can verify that Python is installed by typing `python` from your shell; you should see something like:

```bash

[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

### Install LinkML

The latest version can always be installed with:

```bash
pip install linkml
```

## Alternative: Use the official Docker/OCI image

You can also use the [official Docker/OCI image for LinkML](https://hub.docker.com/r/linkml/linkml):

To start a shell from the image:
```bash
docker run -v ./:/work -w /work/ --rm -ti docker.io/linkml/linkml
```

Then try some commands:
```bash
linkml-ws --help
gen-project --help
```
