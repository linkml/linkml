# Quick Install Guide

There are multiple ways to installing LinkML.

## Local installation: Use the Python package

If you are developing locally you can install LinkML as a python package in your local environment.

### Install Python

Get the latest version of Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/ or with your operating systemâ€™s package manager.

You can verify that Python is installed by typing `python` from your shell; you should see something like:

```bash
Python 3.9.5 (v3.9.5:0a7dcbdb13, May  3 2021, 13:17:02) 
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

### Install LinkML

The latest version can always be installed with:

```bash
pip install linkml
```

## Alternative: Use the official Docker/OCI image

You can also use the [official Docker/OCI image for LinkML](https://hub.docker.com/r/linkml/linkml):

To start a shell from the image:
```bash
docker run -v ./:/work -w /work/ --rm -ti docker.io/linkml/linkml
```

Then try some commands:
```bash
linkml-ws --help
gen-project --help
```

## Modular Installation

Starting in [`v1.9.0`](../code/deprecation.rst), to reduce the number of dependencies needed for the average installation,
dependencies for some generators are organized as `extras`. To install them, you will need to
specify them to pip like:

```shell
# From PyPI
python -m pip install 'linkml[extra]'
# multiple...
python -m pip install 'linkml[extra1,extra2]'
# From a local clone of the repository
python -m pip install '.[extra]'
# With Poetry
poetry install -E extra
```

The following generators need extras:

```{list-table} Extra Dependencies
:header-rows: 1

* - Generator
  - Extras
* - {class}`~linkml.generators.shaclgen.ShaclGenerator`
  - `shacl`
* - {class}`~linkml.generators.shexgen.ShexGenerator`
  - `shex`
* - {class}`~linkml.generators.excelgen.ExcelGenerator`
  - `excel`

```
