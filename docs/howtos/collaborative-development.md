# How to run a collaborative data modeling project

This document describes how to run a collaborative data modeling project using the [LinkML](https://linkml.io) modeling language.

This guide is intended to serve as a practical how-to for running a collaborative data modeling project,
adaptable to the diverse needs of different projects.
Whether you're tackling a small, focused endeavor or a large-scale, multi-organizational initiative,
the principles and practices outlined here can be tailored to your project's unique requirements.

Our aim is to provide a straightforward, actionable set of guidelines that balance the technical aspects
of data modeling with the nuances of collaborative work.
You'll find insights on initiating and planning your project, managing contributions,
and maintaining effective communication and governance.

Remember, the success of a data modeling project hinges on a well-coordinated blend of technical
proficiency and collaborative synergy.
This guide is designed to equip you with the essentials for navigating these complexities efficiently.

This guide is a work in progress, and in the spirit of the guide itself, we welcome comments ([issue 1744](https://github.com/linkml/linkml/issues/1744))
and pull requests.

## Sources

In this guide we draw from:

- The O3 principles: [Open code, open data, and open infrastructure to promote the longevity of curated scientific resources](https://osf.io/vuzt3/)
- The [OBook](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook), and in particular [How to be an Open Science Engineer - maximising impact for a better world](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/howto/open-science-engineer/)
- The Tislab collaboration guide (link TBD)

## Principles

### Version Control Your Schema

(adapted from O3 principles)

Version control systems like git track changes in files and enable multiple users to collaborate. They are widely used for maintaining code,
but can (and should) also be used to maintain and manage data, metadata, ontologies, schemas, and other semantic artifacts.

Some projects may opt to manage their data alongside the schema in the same repo. This may be a good pattern
for "registry" style projects, but in other cases the data may be best managed separately in a dedicated
store or a repository like Zenodo or Figshare.

### Permissively License Your Code and Data

(adapted from O3 principles)

Using recognizable, permissive licenses (e.g., CC0, CC BY) encourages contribution and ensures content longevity.
Non-permissive licenses or custom terms can hinder reuse and engagement.
Permissive licensing doesn't typically lead to a lack of credit for the original resource.

### Use Technical Workflows (Automation) and Social Workflows

(adapted from O3 principles)

Automating quality control, generation of artifacts, releases, and deployment helps in maintaining and contributing to projects.
This includes using continuous integration for quality checks, automating the generation of data views, and packaging data and code for easy deployment.

The [LinkML Cookiecutter](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter/) provides a template for a project that
includes a number of automation features using GitHub actions.

Implementing social workflows through tools like GitHub enhances community engagement.
Transparent discussion forums, giving credit to contributors, and using issue trackers and discussion boards are crucial for maintaining a dynamic and active contributor base.

Document or reference best practices for contributing to the schema. This includes things such 
as [keeping issues and pull requests small and atomic](https://codeinthehole.com/tips/advanced-pull-request-crafting/).

### Establish Project Governance

(adapted from O3 principles and TisLab guide)

Clear governance defines roles, responsibilities, and behavior expectations in a project.
Establishing codes of conduct, standard operating procedures, and guidelines for administration and contribution roles is vital. Governance should evolve over time to meet the project's needs.

You may wish to use an existing governance model or community documents as a starting point for your project:

- Bioschemas [community](https://bioschemas.org/community/) and [governance](https://github.com/Bioschemas/governance/blob/master/governance.md) docs
- [Biolink](https://biolink.github.io/biolink-model/) 
- schema.org [how we work](https://schema.org/docs/howwework.html)
- [GA4GH Constitution](https://www.ga4gh.org/constitution/)
- [Bioregistry](https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/blob/main/docs/GOVERNANCE.md)

### Attract and Engage Contributors

Detailed contribution guidelines, offering various ways to contribute, and hosting projects in neutral spaces increase contributor engagement and recruitment. Projects should be accessible and welcoming to new contributors to ensure longevity and development.

The [LinkML Cookiecutter](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter/) provides a template 
for project documents such as a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file and a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file that can be
adapted for your project.

The core schema developers should be familiar with existing best practice for contribution.

## Open Science Principles

Many schemas developed in LinkML are not intended to be used in isolation, but rather as part of a larger
open ecosystem. The [OBook](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook) has a chapter [How to be an Open Science Engineer - maximising impact for a better world](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/howto/open-science-engineer/) outlines principles and practices for effective collaboration and impact in the field of open science engineering.

Here's a summary:

### Principle of Collaboration

Emphasizes the importance of social collaborative workflows in open science. It advises on effective online communication, upvoting helpful answers on platforms like Stack Overflow and GitHub, answering questions even outside one's specific project, conducting basic research before posting queries, and continuously improving open science documentation.

### Principle of Upstream Fixing

Encourages fixing issues at the earliest possible stage in the dependency chain, maximizing the impact of changes and benefiting a wider community. It includes a case study highlighting the importance of quality control and community contributions in ontology development.

### Principle of No-ownership

Advocates for a mindset of shared ownership and collaborative development in open science projects, particularly in the context of publicly funded work like ontologies. It suggests embracing community-driven development without specific owners or decision-makers and emphasizes the importance of proactive involvement and decision-making in a decentralized environment.

The document also includes a TL;DR summary with key takeaways:

- Upvote and get involved in issue trackers.
- Always conduct a basic search before asking questions.
- Continuously improve documentation.
- Be generous with likes and gratitude.
- Promote open communication and push fixes upstream.
- See issues and pull requests through to the end.
- Encourage reviewing each other's work and reducing fear of making mistakes or having pull requests rejected.

These principles and practices are aimed at fostering a more collaborative, efficient, and impactful open science community.

### schema.org

__SOURCE__: schema.org [how we work](https://schema.org/docs/howwework.html)

The document titled "How We Work - Schema.org" provides an overview of the processes and practices employed by Schema.org in developing and updating its schemas. Here's a summary:

- **Overview and Process**:
  - Schema.org updates materials through official named releases every few weeks.
  - Simple improvements and bug fixes can be fast-tracked as "Early Access Fixes".
  - A development version of the site, "webschemas.org", reflects the latest work-in-progress based on community discussions and proposals.
  - A "pending" extension at pending.webschemas.org showcases new vocabulary proposals, which may not yet reflect wider consensus.
  - Steering group reviews and approves release candidates; if no concerns are raised within 10 business days, the official site is updated.

- **Versioning and Change Control**:
  - Schema.org is developed incrementally, with several updates a year, each documented as a release.
  - Content for each release is based on public discussions and unanimous agreement of the Steering Group.
  - Two types of extension vocabulary are introduced: hosted (part of Schema.org but tagged within a subdomain) and external (published elsewhere and managed by other organizations).

- **Schema Structure**:
  - Schema.org contains term definitions (types, properties, enumerated values), machine-readable files, and a JSON-LD context file.
  - The approach to schema definitions is based on W3C RDFS with customizations.

- **Extensibility Mechanisms**:
  - Schema.org allows for extensibility through mechanisms independent of its vocabulary definitions and release planning.
  - This includes publishing Schema.org data alongside other structured data types and using PropertyValue and Role mechanisms for additional annotations.

- **Early Access Fixes and Pending Releases**:
  - Early Access Fixes allow for rapid updates between official releases.
  - The "pending schemas" extension is a staging area for work-in-progress terms, subject to change and community review.

- **Workflow FAQ**:
  - The document addresses common questions regarding public-vocabs, W3C WebSchemas group, the role of the Schema.org webmaster, and how to get involved or propose new schemas.

- **Related Links and Further Reading**:
  - The document provides links to additional resources for more in-depth understanding of Schema.org's work and processes.

This document serves as a comprehensive guide to the operational framework, versioning system, and collaborative nature of Schema.org's efforts in structuring and standardizing web data.
