title: LinkML Schema Metamodel
name: meta
description: |-
  The metamodel for schemas defined using the Linked Data Modeling Language framework.

  For more information on LinkML:

  * [linkml.io](https://linkml.io) main website
  * [specification](https://w3id.org/linkml/docs/specification/)

  LinkML is self-describing. Every LinkML schema consists of elements
  that instantiate classes in this metamodel.

  Core metaclasses:

  * [SchemaDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/SchemaDefinition)
  * [ClassDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/ClassDefinition)
  * [SlotDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/SlotDefinition)
  * [TypeDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/TypeDefinition)

  There are many subsets of *profiles* of the metamodel, for different purposes:

  * [MinimalSubset](https://w3id.org/linkml/MinimalSubset)
  * [BasicSubset](https://w3id.org/linkml/BasicSubset)

  For canonical reference documentation on any metamodel construct,
  refer to the official URI for each construct, e.g.
  [https://w3id.org/linkml/is_a](https://w3id.org/linkml/is_a)

subsets:
  MinimalSubset:
    rank: 0
    title: minimal subset
    description: |-
      The absolute minimal set of elements necessary for defining any schema.

      schemas conforming to the minimal subset consist of classes, with all slots
      inlined as attributes. There are no enums.
  BasicSubset:
    rank: 1
    title: basic subset
    description: |-
      An extension of MinimalSubset that avoids advanced constructs and can be implemented by a broad variety of tools.

      This subset roughly corresponds to the union of most standard constructs used in relational datamodel modeling,
      object oriented modeling, and simple JSON-style modeling, while avoiding more advanced constructs from these languages.

      It is often possible to translate from a more expressive schema to a BasicSubset schema, through a schema derivation
      process
  SpecificationSubset:
    rank: 2
    title: specification subset
    description: |-
      A subset that includes all the metamodel elements that form part of the normative LinkML specification.

      The complete LinkML specification can be found at [linkml:specification](https://w3id.org/linkml/specification)
  RelationalModelProfile:
    rank: 3
    title: relational model profile
    description: |-
      A profile that includes all the metamodel elements whose semantics can be expressed using the classic Relational Model.
      The Relational Model excludes collections (multivalued slots) as first class entities. Instead, these must be
      mapped to backreferences

      The classic Relational Model excludes inheritance and polymorphism -- these must be rolled down to
      concrete classes or otherwise transformed.
  ObjectOrientedProfile:
    rank: 4
    title: object oriented profile
    description: |-
      A profile that includes all the metamodel elements whose semantics can be expressed using a minimal
      implementation of the object oriented metamodel as employed by languages such as Java and Python, or
      in modeling frameworks like UML
  OwlProfile:
    title: owl profile
    description: |-
      A profile that includes all the metamodel elements whose semantics can be expressed in OWL

      while 'values_from' is the identifier of an entire value set.  Additionally, this is different than an enumeration
      in that in an enumeration, the values of the enumeration are listed directly in the model itself.
      Setting this property on a slot does not guarantee an expansion of the ontological hierarchy into an
      enumerated list of possible values in every serialization of the model.

        Many slots may be reused across different classes, but the meaning of the slot may be refined by context.
        For example, a generic association model may use slots subject/predicate/object with generic semantics and
        minimal constraints. When this is subclasses, e.g. to disease-phenotype associations then slot usage may
        specify both local naming (e.g. subject=disease) and local constraints

      Used on a slot that stores the string serialization of the containing object. The syntax follows python

      We call the slot with the serialization the s-slot, the slots used in the {}s are v-slots. If both
      s-slots and v-slots are populated on an object then the value of the s-slot should correspond to the
      expansion.

      Implementations of frameworks may choose to use this property to either (a) PARSE: implement automated normalizations
      by parsing denormalized strings into complex objects (b) GENERATE: implement automated to_string labeling of
      complex objects

      For example, a Measurement class may have 3 fields: unit, value, and string_value. The string_value slot
      may have a string_serialization of {value}{unit} such that if unit=cm and value=2, the value of
      string_value shouldd be 2cm

      LinkML provides enums to allow string values to be restricted to one of a set of permissible
      values (specified statically or dynamically).

      Enum bindings allow enums to be bound to any object, including complex nested objects. For
      example, given a (generic) class Concept with slots id and label, it may be desirable to restrict the
      values the id takes on in a given context. For example, a HumanSample class may have a slot for
      representing sample site, with a range of concept, but the values of that slot may be restricted to
      concepts from a particular branch of an anatomy ontology.

    comments:
      - in the context of Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling, this is used to state that a class models a relationship between entities, and should be drawn with a diamond
      - in the context of RDF, this should be used when instances of the class are `rdf:Statement`s

    comments:
      - this should only be used on slots that are applicable to class that represent relationships
      - in the context of RDF, this should be used for slots that can be modeled using the RDF reification vocabulary
      - in the context of property graphs, this should be used on edge classes to indicate which slots represent the input and output nodes
