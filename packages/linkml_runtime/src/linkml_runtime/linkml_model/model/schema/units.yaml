  abbreviation:
    slot_uri: qudt:abbreviation
    description: >-
      An abbreviation for a unit is a short ASCII string that is used in place of the full name for the unit in 
      contexts where non-ASCII characters would be problematic, or where using the abbreviation will enhance 
      readability. When a power of a base unit needs to be expressed, such as squares this can be done using 
      abbreviations rather than symbols (source: qudt)

    description: >-
      A unit of measure, or unit, is a particular quantity value that has been chosen as a scale for 
      measuring other quantities the same kind (more generally of equivalent dimension).
