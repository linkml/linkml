# linkml_model image
This directory contains a copy of the linkml_model files.  Its purpose is two fold:
1) To prevent ugly circular dependencies -- the linkml-model package depends on the linkml-runtime, amongst other things
2) To provide a stable copy to implement against

# TODO:
[] We need to come up with rules and process for updating this directory
