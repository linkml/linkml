# ==================================
# Common type definitions
#
# Definition consists of:
#    <name>:   type name
#      uri:    RDF datatype
#      base:   python base type
#      repr:   representational form in yaml/python if different than representation in base
#      (additional metadata)
# ==================================
types:
  string:
    uri: xsd:string
    base: str
    description: A character string
    notes: >-
      In RDF serializations, a slot with range of string is treated as a literal or type xsd:string.  
      If you are authoring schemas in LinkML YAML, the type is referenced with the lower case "string".
    exact_mappings:
      - schema:Text

  integer:
    uri: xsd:integer
    base: int
    description: An integer
    notes: >-
      If you are authoring schemas in LinkML YAML, the type is referenced with the lower case "integer".
    exact_mappings:
      - schema:Integer

  boolean:
    uri: xsd:boolean
    base: Bool
    repr: bool
    description: A binary (true or false) value
    notes: >-
      If you are authoring schemas in LinkML YAML, the type is referenced with the lower case "boolean".
    exact_mappings:
      - schema:Boolean

  float:
    uri: xsd:float
    base: float
    description: A real number that conforms to the xsd:float specification
    notes: >-
      If you are authoring schemas in LinkML YAML, the type is referenced with the lower case "float".
    exact_mappings:
      - schema:Float

  double:
    uri: xsd:double
    base: float
    description: A real number that conforms to the xsd:double specification
    notes: >-
      If you are authoring schemas in LinkML YAML, the type is referenced with the lower case "double".
    close_mappings:
      - schema:Float

  decimal:
    uri: xsd:decimal
    base: Decimal
    description: A real number with arbitrary precision that conforms to the xsd:decimal specification
    notes: >-
      If you are authoring schemas in LinkML YAML, the type is referenced with the lower case "decimal".
    broad_mappings:
      - schema:Number

  time:
    uri: xsd:time
    base: XSDTime
    repr: str
    description: A time object represents a (local) time of day, independent of any particular day
    notes:
      - URI is dateTime because OWL reasoners do not work with straight date or time
      - If you are authoring schemas in LinkML YAML, the type is referenced with the lower case "time".
    exact_mappings:
      - schema:Time

  date:
    uri: xsd:date
    base: XSDDate
    repr: str
    description: a date (year, month and day) in an idealized calendar
    notes:
      - URI is dateTime because OWL reasoners don't work with straight date or time
      - If you are authoring schemas in LinkML YAML, the type is referenced with the lower case "date".
    exact_mappings:
      - schema:Date

  datetime:
    uri: xsd:dateTime
    repr: str
    base: XSDDateTime
    description: The combination of a date and time
    notes: >-
      If you are authoring schemas in LinkML YAML, the type is referenced with the lower case "datetime".
    exact_mappings:
      - schema:DateTime

  date_or_datetime:
    uri: linkml:DateOrDatetime
    repr: str
    base: str
    description: Either a date or a datetime

  curie:
    uri: xsd:string
    base: Curie
    repr: str
    description: a compact URI
    comments:
      - in RDF serializations this MUST be expanded to a URI
      - in non-RDF serializations MAY be serialized as the compact representation
    notes: >-
      If you are authoring schemas in LinkML YAML, the type is referenced with the lower case "curie".

  uri:
    uri: xsd:anyURI
    base: URI
    repr: str
    description: a complete URI
    comments:
      - >-
        in RDF serializations a slot with range of uri is treated as a literal or type xsd:anyURI unless it is an identifier or
        a reference to an identifier, in which case it is translated directly to a node

    base: str
    repr: str
    description: >-
