      elements:
        description: >-
          the collection of values that make up the array. The elements have a *direct* representation which is
          an ordered sequence of values. The elements also have an *array interpretation*, where each
          element has a unique index which is determined by array_linearization_order

      a data structure containing an NDArray and a set of one-dimensional series that are used to label
      the elements of the array
