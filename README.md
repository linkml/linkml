# LinkML - Linked Data Modeling Language

LinkML is a linked data modeling language following object-oriented and ontological principles. LinkML models are typically authored in YAML, and can be converted to other schema representation formats such as JSON or RDF.

This repo holds the tools for generating and working with LinkML. For the LinkML schema (metamodel), please see https://github.com/linkml/linkml-model

The complete documentation for LinkML can be found here:
