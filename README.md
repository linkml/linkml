# Archived Repo Notice

This repository was archived in December 2025.
Before this point is was a dependency in the [Data Vocabs ](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/data-vocab) application.
It was decoupled in [data-vocab#147](https://github.com/govuk-one-login/data-vocab/pull/147).

We'd forked and customised LinkML to cater for our use case.
But then were stuck with a largely unmaintaiend fork that accued security updates and was diffiuclt to reconcile against main due to our changes.

The few relevant commits where held on [a data-vocab branch](https://github.com/linkml/linkml/compare/main...govuk-one-login:linkml:data-vocab).

All other data in this repo is effectively already public domain, and nothing else should be considered sensitive.

# LinkML - Linked Data Modeling Language

LinkML is a linked data modeling language following object-oriented and ontological principles. LinkML models are typically authored in YAML, and can be converted to other schema representation formats such as JSON or RDF.

This repo holds the tools for generating and working with LinkML. For the LinkML schema (metamodel), please see https://github.com/linkml/linkml-model

The complete documentation for LinkML can be found here:
