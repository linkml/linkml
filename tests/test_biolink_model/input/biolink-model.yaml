# CURIE namespaces (prefixes/base URI's) mappings of prefixes used in the body of the Biolink Model specification
# are resolved using a specific precedence order, for use in the generation of the Biolink Model context.jsonld
# mappings to namespaces. Any prefixes encountered in the Biolink Model but not resolved by the following
# precedence sources, are anonymously declared by linkml as http://example.org/UNKNOWN/ rooted base URI's
# which should ideally be repaired in one of the precedence lists.

  qualified predicate:
    is_a: qualifier
    description: >-
      Predicate to be used in an association when subject and object qualifiers are present and the full
      reading of the statement requires a qualification to the predicate in use in order to refine or
      increase the specificity of the full statement reading.  This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead of that
      expressed by the primary predicate, in a ‘full statement’ reading of the association, where qualifier-based
      semantics are included.  This is necessary only in cases where the primary predicate does not work in a
      full statement reading.
    notes: >-
      to express the statement that “Chemical X causes increased expression of Gene Y”, the core triple is read
      using the fields subject:ChemX, predicate:affects, object:GeneY . . . and the full statement is read using
      the fields subject:ChemX, qualified_predicate:causes, object:GeneY, object_aspect: expression,
      object_direction:increased. The predicate ‘affects’ is needed for the core triple reading, but does not make
      sense in the full statement reading  (because “Chemical X affects increased expression of Gene Y'' is not
      what we mean to say here: it causes increased expression of Gene Y)

  statement qualifier:

    is_a: related to at instance level
    description: >-
      Expresses a relationship between two named things where the relationship is typically generated statistically
      (though not in all cases), and is weaker than its child, 'correlated with', but stronger than its parent,
      'related to'. This relationship holds between two concepts represented by variables for which a statistical
      dependence is demonstrated.  E.g. the statement “Atrial Fibrillation (Afib) is associated with Myocardial
      Infraction (MI)” asserts that having Afib is not statistically independent from whether a patient
      will also have MI. Note that in Translator associations, the subject and object concepts may map exactly to
      the statistical variables, or represent related entities for which the variables serve as proxies in an
      Association (e.g. diseases, chemical entities or processes).

      This predicate is used simply to report observations of use in the real world, and is agnostic to whether the

      patient on their own accord or prescribed by a clinician, as an off-label or an approved intervention. In
      practice, it would be used to represent records/statements from patient self-reporting sources like FAERS / AEOLUS

      instances of off-label prescription of drugs for specific conditions (e.g. here, here, here).

      study that hypothesized an ability to treat the condition (in humans or other biological systems/organisms).
    notes: >-
      This predicate is helpful both as a grouping predicate to aid in searching for broader senses of treating a
      condition, and as a catch-all for representing sources that are not clear about the sense of treats that is
      being reported. For example, text-mined statements concerning treatments for disease are based on sentences
      that can report treatment in any of these different senses and thus require a broader predicate such as
      this to safely report statement semantics.

      scope or specificity of what the statement expresses to be true.
    notes: >-
      The notion of a 'level' of knowledge can in one sense relate to the strength 
      of a statement - i.e. how confident we are that it says something true about
      our domain of discourse. Here, we can generally consider Assertions to be 
      stronger than Entailments to be stronger than Predictions. 
      But in another sense, 'level' of knowledge can refer to the scope or specificity of
      what a statement expresses - on a spectrum from context-specific results of a data
      analysis, to generalized assertions of knowledge or fact. Here, Statistical 
      Associations and  Observations represent more foundational statements that are only 
      slightly removed from the data on which they are based (the former reporting the 
      direct results of  an analysis in terms of correlations between variables in the data,
      and the latter describing phenomena that were observed/reported to have occurred).

        Note that this property indicates the type of agent who produced a 
        final statement of knowledge, which is often different from the 
        agent oragents who produced information used as evidence to 
        support generation of this knowledge. For example, if a human curator
        concludes that a particular gene variant causes a medical condition -
        based on their interpretation of information produced by computational 
        modeling tools, automated data analysis pipelines, and robotic laboratory
        assay systems - the agent_type for this statement is 'manual agent' - 
        despite all of the evidence being created by automated agents. But if any
        of these systems is programmed to generate knowledge statements 
        directly and without human assistance, the statement would be attributed 
        to an 'automated_agent'.

        This is modeled as a mixin. 'ontology class' should not be the primary type of a

      - >-
        Note that formally this is a metaclass. Instances of this class are instances in the graph,
        but can be the object of 'type' edges. For example, if we had a node in the graph representing
        a specific brain of a specific patient (e.g brain001), this could have a category of bl:Sample,
        and by typed more specifically with an ontology class UBERON:nnn, which has as category bl:AnatomicalEntity

      A collection of data items from a study that are about a particular study subject or experimental unit (the
      'focus' of the Result) - optionally with context/provenance metadata that may be relevant to the interpretation
      of this data as evidence.
    notes:
      The data/metadata included in a Study Result object are typically a subset of data from a larger study data set,
      that are selected by a curator because they may be useful as evidence for deriving knowledge about a specific
      focus of the study. The notion of a 'study' here is defined broadly to include any research activity at any
      scale that is aimed at generating knowledge or hypotheses. This may include a single assay or computational
      analyses, or a larger scale clinical trial or experimental research investigation.

          When studying a new drug, it can sometimes take many years to learn whether a drug actually
          provides a real effect on how a patient survives, feels, or functions. A positive therapeutic
          effect that is clinically meaningful in the context of a given disease is known as “clinical benefit”.
          Mindful of the fact that it may take an extended period of time to measure a drug’s intended clinical
          benefit, in 1992 FDA instituted the Accelerated Approval regulations. These regulations allowed drugs
          for serious conditions that filled an unmet medical need to be approved based on a surrogate endpoint.
          Using a surrogate endpoint enabled the FDA to approve these drugs faster.

          the drug review time and created a two-tiered system of review times – Standard Review and Priority
          Review. A Priority Review designation means FDA’s goal is to take action on an application

    permissible_values:
      "life_threatening_adverse_event":
        description: >-
          An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 'life-threatening' if, in the view of either
          the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death.
          It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more
          severe form, might have caused death.
      "serious_adverse_event":
        description: >-
          An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 'serious' if, in the view of either the
          investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening adverse event,
          inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity
          or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth
          defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization
          may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or
          subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this
          definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment
          in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient
          hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
      "suspected_adverse_reaction":
        description: >-
           means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.
           For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 'reasonable possibility' means there is evidence to suggest a
           causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser
           degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.
      "unexpected_adverse_event":
        description: >-
          An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered 'unexpected' if it is not listed in the
          investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an
          investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described
          in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. For example,
          under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the
          investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral
          thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the
          investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 'Unexpected', as used in this definition,
          also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure
          as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but
          are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.

        description: >-
          A human agent who is responsible for generating a statement of
          knowledge. The human may utilize computationally generated
          information as evidence for the resulting knowledge, 
          but the human is the one who ultimately interprets/reasons with 
          this evidence to produce a statement of knowledge.
      automated_agent:
        description: >-
          An automated agent, typically a software program or tool, that is 
          responsible for generating a statement of knowledge. Human contribution 
          to the knowledge creation process ends with the definition and coding
          of algorithms or analysis pipelines that get executed by the automated
          agent.
      data_analysis_pipeline:
        is_a: automated_agent
        description: >-
          An automated agent that executes an analysis workflow over data and 
          reports the direct results of the analysis. These typically report 
          statistical associations/correlations between variables in the input
          dataset, and do not interpret/infer broader conclusions from associations
          the analysis reveals in the data.
        notes: >-
          If an analysis pipeline includes any rules for generating broader 
          conclusions based on the dataset-specific statistical correlations
          it calculates (e.g. create a 'treats' edge when the analysis reveals a 
          drug-disease correlation in the data with statistical scores that meet a 
          certain threshold) - we would consider this agent to be a Computational Model
          rather than just a Data Analysis Pipeline.
      computational_model:
        is_a: automated_agent
        description: >-
          An automated agent that generates knowledge statements (typically
          predictions) based on rules/logic explicitly encoded in an algorithm
          (e.g. heuristic models, supervised classifiers), or learned from patterns 
          observed in data (e.g. ML models, unsupervised classifiers).
        notes: >-
          The bar is quite low relatively for what is considered to be a 
          ‘computational model’ by our definition. Even agents/tools that apply 
          simple rules or logic to the output of an ingest or analysis pipeline
          to allow for a stronger or more general conclusion to be stated can 
          qualify an agent as a model. For example, an ingest pipeline that applies rules to its ingest of 
          clinical trials data to create a 'treats' prediction edge when the 
          source reports a drug to be in phase 2 or 3 trials represents a
          computational model because it is automatically drawing a stronger
          conclusion than the source reports, based on logic encoded in the ingest
          pipeline. Similarly, a data analysis pipeline that is extended with rules to 
          automatically generate broader conclusions based on dataset-specific
          statistical correlations (e.g. create a 'treats' edge when the analysis
          reveals a drug-disease correlation in the data with statistical scores 
          that meet a certain threshold), would also qualify as a computational 
          model by our definition.
      text_mining_agent:
        is_a: automated_agent
        description: >-
          An automated agent that uses Natural Language Processing to recognize
          concepts and/or relationships in text, and report them using formally
          encoded semantics (e.g. as an edge in a knowledge graph).
        notes: >-
          The original statement in the source text is typically made by a human / 
          manual agent, but if a specific encoding of this knowledge is produced
          by a text-mining tool, it has an agent_type of 'text_mining_agent'.
          Examples of text mining agents include SemmedDB, and the Translator
          Text-Mining Knowledge Provider. Note that text-mining tools are prone to erroneous interpretation of 
          concepts and relationships, and can fail to provide important details 
          about the context in which the original knowledge was reported - so
          users should always consult the source text for a text-mined statement
          to assess its veracity and relevance.
      image_processing_agent:
        is_a: automated_agent
        description: >-
          An automated agent that processes images to generate textual statements of 
          knowledge derived from the image and/or expressed in text the image 
          depicts (e.g. via OCR).
      manual_validation_of_automated_agent:
        description: >-
          A human agent reviews and validates/approves the veracity of knowledge 
          that is initially generated by an automated agent.
        notes: >-
          This term applies when a human was only involved in evaluating the veracity
          of a knowledge statement that was generated by an automated agent. It is 
          important to indicate when such manual review has occurred, because it can
          give a user more confidence in an automated statement.
      not_provided:
        description: >-
          The agent type is not provided, typically because it cannot be determined
          from available information if the agent that generated the knowledge is 
          manual or automated.

  KnowledgeLevelEnum:
    permissible_values:
      knowledge_assertion:
        aliases: ['assertion']
        description: >-
          A statement of purported fact that is put forth by an agent as true,
          based on assessment of direct evidence. Assertions are likely but not 
          definitively true.
        notes: >-
          Knowledge Assertions are supported by direct evidence deemed sufficient
          by some agent to support a confidence assertion of truth. Our certainty 
          in this truth is not absolute, but is typically higher than for Predictions.
      logical_entailment:
        aliases: ['deductive_inference']
        description: >-
          A statement reporting a conclusion that follows logically from premises
          representing established facts or knowledge assertions (e.g. fingernail
          part of finger, finger part of hand --> fingernail part of hand).
        notes: >-
          These statements report entailed conclusions derived through dedictive inference.
          They are not directly asserted by a source, but logically follow from statement(s) 
          a source does make - and are necessarily true if their supporting premises are true. 
          In practice, these will primarily be entailments based on logic encoded in ontologies. 
          Examples include propagation of annotated knowledge to hierarchically-related concepts,
          across paths through a graph constructed from transitive relationships, or sets of 
          relationships that support property chain inference.
      prediction:
        aliases: ['hypothesis']
        description: >-
          A statement of a possible fact based on probabilistic forms of reasoning over
          more indirect forms of evidence, that lead to more speculative conclusions.
        notes: >-
          Predictions typically result from non-deductive forms of reasoning - e.g.
          inductive and deductive inference, or statistical inference where conclusions
          are drawn about a broader/global population based on data from a representative
          cohort. For example, a prediction that a drug may treat a particular disease based on its chemical
          similarity to known drugs that treat the disease, and the fact that it can inhibit proteins 
          in a pathway that is associated with the disease
          As Predictions are based on weaker forms of inference and evidence, they are typically 
          considered lower confidence statements as compared to Knowledge Assertions and Logical
          Entailments.
      statistical_association:
        description: >-
          A statement that reports concepts representing variables in a dataset to be statistically
          associated with each other in a particular cohort (e.g. 'Metformin Treatment (variable 1)
          is correlated with Diabetes Diagnosis (variable 2) in EHR dataset X').
        notes: >-
          Such statements report the direct results of some statistical analysis. Their scope is limited
          tp the cohort/dataset interrogated in the analysis, and they do not make broader claims or draw 
          more meaningful conclusions about the domain of discourse. Note however that such Statistical 
          Associations can be used as evidence to support a more pointed/precise Prediction or Assertion 
          of knowledge. For example, e.g. a Statistical Association between 'Metformin Prescription' and
          'Diabetes Diagnosis' in EHR records could support a Prediction that 'Metformin treats Diabetes', 
          or 'Metformin causes Diabetes'. This 'treats' edge may have a knowledge_level of 'Prediction', 
          but the provider could use the 'evidence_type' edge property to indicate that this prediction is 
          based on a 'Statistical Association'. Because Statistical Associations directly report analysis-specific 
          results, we can consider them to be inherently true statements, whose broader utility is dependent on 
          subsequent generalization of the reported result to a broader population, and/or interpretation of the 
          result as support for a more meaningful statements about the domain of discourse.
      observation:
        description: >-
          A statement reporting (and possibly quantifying) a phenomenon that was observed to occur - 
          absent any analysis or interpretation that generates a statistical association or supports
          a broader conclusion or inference.
        notes: >-
          An observation that "56362 people self-reported taking melatonin to treat migraines"
          is agnostic to whether melatonin is an effective or approved treatment - it only claims that it was
          taken for this purpose. Such observations, however, may be used as the basis for predicting that a 
          drug may be efficacious against a disease.
      not_provided:
        description: >-
          The knowledge level is not provided, typically because it cannot be determined from available.
          information.
        notes: >-
          This term is most often applied for text-mined edges, as NLP tools are typically not able to detect
          a specific knowledge level for the concept relationships they extract (e.g. whether the author 
          was predicting or asserting a relationship, or merely observed it to occur).
