## Parents

 *  is_a: [Attribute](Attribute.md) - A property or characteristic of an entity. For example, an apple may have properties such as color, shape, age, crispiness. An environmental sample may have attributes such as depth, lat, long, material.

## Children

 * [GenotypicSex](GenotypicSex.md) - An attribute corresponding to the genotypic sex of the individual, based upon genotypic composition of sex chromosomes.
 * [PhenotypicSex](PhenotypicSex.md) - An attribute corresponding to the phenotypic sex of the individual, based upon the reproductive organs present.

## Attributes


### Inherited from attribute:

 * [id](id.md)  <sub>1..1</sub>
     * Description: A unique identifier for an entity. Must be either a CURIE shorthand for a URI or a complete URI
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [type](type.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [description](description.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: a human-readable description of an entity
     * Range: [NarrativeText](types/NarrativeText.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [has attribute](has_attribute.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: connects any entity to an attribute
     * Range: [Attribute](Attribute.md)
     * in subsets: (samples)
 * [provided by](provided_by.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: The value in this node property represents the knowledge provider that created or assembled the node and all of its attributes.  Used internally to represent how a particular node made its way into a knowledge provider or graph.
     * Range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [xref](xref.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: Alternate CURIEs for a thing
     * Range: [Uriorcurie](types/Uriorcurie.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [named thing➞category](named_thing_category.md)  <sub>1..\*</sub>
     * Description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized. Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.
 * In a neo4j database this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.
 * In an RDF database it should be a biolink model class URI.
This field is multi-valued. It should include values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`, ...
In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity, biolink:NamedThing}
     * Range: [CategoryType](types/CategoryType.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal)
 * [attribute➞name](attribute_name.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: The human-readable 'attribute name' can be set to a string which reflects its context of interpretation, e.g. SEPIO evidence/provenance/confidence annotation or it can default to the name associated with the 'has attribute type' slot ontology term.
     * Range: [LabelType](types/LabelType.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)
 * [has attribute type](has_attribute_type.md)  <sub>1..1</sub>
     * Description: connects an attribute to a class that describes it
     * Range: [OntologyClass](OntologyClass.md)
     * in subsets: (samples)
 * [has quantitative value](has_quantitative_value.md)  <sub>0..\*</sub>
     * Description: connects an attribute to a value
     * Range: [QuantityValue](QuantityValue.md)
     * in subsets: (samples)
 * [has qualitative value](has_qualitative_value.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: connects an attribute to a value
     * Range: [NamedThing](NamedThing.md)
     * in subsets: (samples)
 * [iri](iri.md)  <sub>0..1</sub>
     * Description: An IRI for an entity. This is determined by the id using expansion rules.
     * Range: [IriType](types/IriType.md)
     * in subsets: (translator_minimal,samples)
