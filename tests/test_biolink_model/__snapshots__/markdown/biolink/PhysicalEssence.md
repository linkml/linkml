## Parents

 *  is_a: [PhysicalEssenceOrOccurrent](PhysicalEssenceOrOccurrent.md) - Either a physical or processual entity.

## Mixin for

 * [AnatomicalEntity](AnatomicalEntity.md) (mixin)  - A subcellular location, cell type or gross anatomical part
 * [ChemicalEntity](ChemicalEntity.md) (mixin)  - A chemical entity is a physical entity that pertains to chemistry or biochemistry.
 * [Gene](Gene.md) (mixin)  - A region (or regions) that includes all of the sequence elements necessary to encode a functional transcript. A gene locus may include regulatory regions, transcribed regions and/or other functional sequence regions.
 * [Genome](Genome.md) (mixin)  - A genome is the sum of genetic material within a cell or virion.
 * [GenomicBackgroundExposure](GenomicBackgroundExposure.md) (mixin)  - A genomic background exposure is where an individual's specific genomic background of genes, sequence variants or other pre-existing genomic conditions constitute a kind of 'exposure' to the organism, leading to or influencing an outcome.
 * [Genotype](Genotype.md) (mixin)  - An information content entity that describes a genome by specifying the total variation in genomic sequence and/or gene expression, relative to some established background
 * [Haplotype](Haplotype.md) (mixin)  - A set of zero or more Alleles on a single instance of a Sequence[VMC]
 * [NucleicAcidEntity](NucleicAcidEntity.md) (mixin)  - A nucleic acid entity is a molecular entity characterized by availability in gene databases of nucleotide-based sequence representations of its precise sequence; for convenience of representation, partial sequences of various kinds are included.
 * [PhysicalEntity](PhysicalEntity.md) (mixin)  - An entity that has material reality (a.k.a. physical essence).
 * [ReagentTargetedGene](ReagentTargetedGene.md) (mixin)  - A gene altered in its expression level in the context of some experiment as a result of being targeted by gene-knockdown reagent(s) such as a morpholino or RNAi.
 * [SequenceVariant](SequenceVariant.md) (mixin)  - A sequence_variant is a non exact copy of a sequence_feature or genome exhibiting one or more sequence_alteration.
