 * [MaterialSample](MaterialSample.md) (mixin)  - A sample is a limited quantity of something (e.g. an individual or set of individuals from a population, or a portion of a substance) to be used for testing, analysis, inspection, investigation, demonstration, or trial use. [SIO]
 * [OrganismalEntity](OrganismalEntity.md) (mixin)  - A named entity that is either a part of an organism, a whole organism, population or clade of organisms, excluding chemical entities
 * [PopulationOfIndividualOrganisms](PopulationOfIndividualOrganisms.md) (mixin)  - A collection of individuals from the same taxonomic class distinguished by one or more characteristics.  Characteristics can include, but are not limited to, shared geographic location, genetics, phenotypes.
 * [Virus](Virus.md) (mixin)  - A virus is a microorganism that replicates itself as a microRNA and infects the host cell.
