- id: knowledge_source
  description: An Information Resource from which the knowledge expressed in an Association
    was retrieved, directly or indirectly. This can be any resource through which
    the knowledge passed on its way to its currently serialized form. In practice,
    implementers should use one of the more specific subtypes of this generic property.
  display_name: knowledge source
- id: primary_knowledge_source
  description: The most upstream source of the knowledge expressed in an Association
    that an implementer can identify.  Performing a rigorous analysis of upstream
    data providers is expected; every effort is made to catalog the most upstream
    source of data in this property.  Only one data source should be declared primary
    in any association.  "aggregator knowledge source" can be used to capture non-primary
    sources.
  display_name: primary knowledge source
- id: aggregator_knowledge_source
  description: An intermediate aggregator resource from which knowledge expressed
    in an Association was retrieved downstream of the original source, on its path
    to its current serialized form.

- id: original_subject
  description: used to hold the original subject of a relation (or predicate) that
    an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model
    specification.
  display_name: original subject

  description: used to hold the original relation/predicate that an external knowledge
    source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model specification.
  display_name: original predicate

  description: used to hold the original object of a relation (or predicate) that
    an external knowledge source uses before transformation to match the biolink-model
    specification.

  description: rdf:type of biolink:Association should be fixed at rdf:Statement
  display_name: association_type
- id: category
  description: "Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized.\
    \ Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.\n * In a neo4j database\
    \ this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.\n * In an RDF database it should\
    \ be a biolink model class URI.\nThis field is multi-valued. It should include\
    \ values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh\
    \ would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`,\
    \ ...\nIn an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This\
    \ can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific\
    \ than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type\
    \ assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than\
    \ anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity,\
    \ biolink:NamedThing}"

  display_name: chemical affects gene association_causal mechanism qualifier
- id: anatomical_context_qualifier
  description: A statement qualifier representing an anatomical location where an

- id: qualified_predicate
  description: "Predicate to be used in an association when subject and object qualifiers\
    \ are present and the full reading of the statement requires a qualification to\
    \ the predicate in use in order to refine or  increase the specificity of the\
    \ full statement reading.  This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead\
    \ of that  expressed by the primary predicate, in a \u2018full statement\u2019\
    \ reading of the association, where qualifier-based  semantics are included. \
    \ This is necessary only in cases where the primary predicate does not work in\
    \ a  full statement reading."

- id: subject
  description: connects an association to the subject of the association. For example,
    in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.

  description: A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate.
    This is analogous to category for nodes.
