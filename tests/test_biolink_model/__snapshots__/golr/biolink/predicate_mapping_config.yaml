- id: mapped_predicate
  description: The predicate that is being replaced by the fully qualified representation
    of predicate + subject and object qualifiers.  Only to be used in test data and
    mapping data to help with the transition to the fully qualified predicate model.
    Not to be used in knowledge graphs.

- id: subject_aspect_qualifier
  description: 'Composes with the core concept to describe new concepts of a different
    ontological type. e.g. a process in which the core concept participates, a function/activity/role
    held by the core concept, or a characteristic/quality that inheres in the core
    concept.  The purpose of the aspect slot is to indicate what aspect is being affected
    in an ''affects'' association.  This qualifier specifies a change in the subject
    of an association (aka: statement).'

  description: "A qualifier that composes with a core subject/object concept to define\
    \ a specific type, variant, alternative version of this concept. The composed\
    \ concept remains a subtype or instance of the core concept. For example, the\
    \ qualifier \u2018mutation\u2019 combines with the core concept \u2018Gene X\u2019\

- id: qualified_predicate
  description: "Predicate to be used in an association when subject and object qualifiers\
    \ are present and the full reading of the statement requires a qualification to\
    \ the predicate in use in order to refine or increase the specificity of the full\
    \ statement reading.  This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead of\
    \ that expressed by the primary predicate, in a \u2018full statement\u2019 reading\
    \ of the association, where qualifier-based semantics are included.  This is necessary\
