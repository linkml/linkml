  and an example of the rewiring that should be done to use a qualified statement
  in its place.

fields:
- id: mapped_predicate
  description: The predicate that is being replaced by the fully qualified representation
    of predicate + subject and object  qualifiers.  Only to be used in test data and
    mapping data to help with the transition to the fully qualified predicate model.
    Not to be used in knowledge graphs.

- id: predicate
  description: A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate.
    This is analogous to category for nodes.
  display_name: predicate
- id: qualified_predicate
  description: "Predicate to be used in an association when subject and object qualifiers\
    \ are present and the full reading of the statement requires a qualification to\
    \ the predicate in use in order to refine or  increase the specificity of the\
    \ full statement reading.  This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead\
    \ of that  expressed by the primary predicate, in a \u2018full statement\u2019\
    \ reading of the association, where qualifier-based  semantics are included. \
    \ This is necessary only in cases where the primary predicate does not work in\
    \ a  full statement reading."

  description: A statement qualifier representing a type of molecular control mechanism
    through which an effect of a chemical on a gene or gene product is mediated (e.g.
    'agonism', 'inhibition', 'allosteric modulation', 'channel blocker')
  display_name: causal mechanism qualifier
- id: anatomical_context_qualifier
  description: A statement qualifier representing an anatomical location where an
    relationship expressed in an association took place (can be a tissue, cell type,
    or sub-cellular location).
  display_name: anatomical context qualifier
- id: species_context_qualifier
  description: A statement qualifier representing a taxonomic category of species
    in which a relationship expressed in an association took place.

    with a high degree of confidence

  cardinality: multi
- id: narrow_match
  description: a list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that
    have a narrower, more specific meaning. Narrower terms are typically shown as
    children in a hierarchy or tree.
  display_name: narrow match
  cardinality: multi
- id: broad_match
  description: a list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that
    have a broader, more general meaning. Broader terms are typically shown as parents
    in a hierarchy or tree.
