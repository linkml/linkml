description: A small molecule entity is a molecular entity characterized by availability
  in small-molecule databases of SMILES, InChI, IUPAC, or other unambiguous representation
  of its precise chemical structure; for convenience of representation, any valid
  chemical representation is included, even if it is not strictly molecular (e.g.,
  sodium ion).

  description: The value in this node property represents the knowledge provider that
    created or assembled the node and all of its attributes.  Used internally to represent
    how a particular node made its way into a knowledge provider or graph.

- id: xref
  description: A database cross reference or alternative identifier for a NamedThing
    or edge between two NamedThings.  This property should point to a database record
    or webpage that supports the existence of the edge, or gives more detail about
    the edge. This property can be used on a node or edge to provide multiple URIs
    or CURIE cross references.

  cardinality: multi
- id: category
  description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized.
    Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database
    this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag. In an RDF database it should be a
    biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values
    for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have
    category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`.
    In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be
    to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than
    something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type
    assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything
    in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity,
    biolink:NamedThing}
