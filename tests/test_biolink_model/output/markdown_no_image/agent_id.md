# Slot: id


Different classes of agents have distinct preferred identifiers. For publishers, use the ISBN publisher code. See https://grp.isbn-international.org/ for publisher code lookups. For editors, authors and  individual providers, use the individual's ORCID if available; Otherwise, a ScopusID, ResearchID or Google Scholar ID ('GSID') may be used if the author ORCID is unknown. Institutional agents could be identified by an International Standard Name Identifier ('ISNI') code.
