  description: The value in this node property represents the knowledge provider that
    created or assembled the node and all of its attributes.  Used internally to represent
    how a particular node made its way into a knowledge provider or graph.

- id: category
  description: "Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized.\
    \ Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.\n * In a neo4j database\
    \ this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.\n * In an RDF database it should\
    \ be a biolink model class URI.\nThis field is multi-valued. It should include\
    \ values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh\
    \ would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`,\
    \ ...\nIn an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This\
    \ can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific\
    \ than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type\
    \ assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than\
    \ anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity,\
    \ biolink:NamedThing}"

- id: authors
  description: connects an publication to the list of authors who contributed to the
    publication. This property should be a comma-delimited list of author names. It
    is recommended that an author's name be formatted as "surname, firstname initial.".   Note
    that this property is a node annotation expressing the citation list of authorship
    which might typically otherwise be more completely documented in biolink:PublicationToProviderAssociation
    defined edges which point to full details about an author and possibly, some qualifiers
    which clarify the specific status of a given author in the publication.

  description: 'Different kinds of publication subtypes will have different preferred
    identifiers (curies when feasible). Precedence of identifiers for scientific articles
    is as follows: PMID if available; DOI if not; actual alternate CURIE otherwise.
    Enclosing publications (i.e. referenced by ''published in'' node property) such
    as books and journals, should have industry-standard identifier such as from ISBN
    and ISSN.'
  display_name: publication_id
- id: name
  description: the 'title' of the publication is generally recorded in the 'name'
    property (inherited from NamedThing). The field name 'title' is now also tagged
    as an acceptable alias for the node property 'name' (just in case).
  display_name: publication_name
- id: type
  description: Ontology term for publication type may be drawn from Dublin Core types
    (https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-type-vocabulary/),
    FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology (https://sparontologies.github.io/fabio/current/fabio.html),
    the MESH publication types (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/pubtypes.html), the Confederation
    of Open Access Repositories (COAR) Controlled Vocabulary for Resource Type Genres
    (http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/resource_types/), Wikidata
    (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Publication_types), or equivalent publication
    type ontology. When a given publication type ontology term is used within a given
    knowledge graph, then the CURIE identified term must be documented in the graph
    as a concept node of biolink:category biolink:OntologyClass.
