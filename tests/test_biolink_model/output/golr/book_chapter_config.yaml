  description: "Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized.\
    \ Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.\n * In a neo4j database\
    \ this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.\n * In an RDF database it should\
    \ be a biolink model class URI.\nThis field is multi-valued. It should include\
    \ values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh\
    \ would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`,\
    \ ...\nIn an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This\
    \ can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific\
    \ than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type\
    \ assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than\
    \ anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity,\
    \ biolink:NamedThing}"

  description: connects an publication to the list of authors who contributed to the
    publication. This property should be a comma-delimited list of author names. It
    is recommended that an author's name be formatted as "surname, firstname initial.".   Note
    that this property is a node annotation expressing the citation list of authorship
    which might typically otherwise be more completely documented in biolink:PublicationToProviderAssociation
    defined edges which point to full details about an author and possibly, some qualifiers
    which clarify the specific status of a given author in the publication.

  description: 'Different kinds of publication subtypes will have different preferred
    identifiers (curies when feasible). Precedence of identifiers for scientific articles
    is as follows: PMID if available; DOI if not; actual alternate CURIE otherwise.
    Enclosing publications (i.e. referenced by ''published in'' node property) such
    as books and journals, should have industry-standard identifier such as from ISBN
    and ISSN.'

  description: the 'title' of the publication is generally recorded in the 'name'

  description: Ontology term for publication type may be drawn from Dublin Core types
    (https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-type-vocabulary/),
    FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology (https://sparontologies.github.io/fabio/current/fabio.html),
    the MESH publication types (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/pubtypes.html), the Confederation
    of Open Access Repositories (COAR) Controlled Vocabulary for Resource Type Genres
    (http://vocabularies.coar-repositories.org/documentation/resource_types/), Wikidata
    (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Publication_types), or equivalent publication
    type ontology. When a given publication type ontology term is used within a given
    knowledge graph, then the CURIE identified term must be documented in the graph
    as a concept node of biolink:category biolink:OntologyClass.
