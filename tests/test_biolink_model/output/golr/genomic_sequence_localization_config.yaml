  localized to. The reference entity may be a chromosome, chromosome region or information
  entity such as a contig.

- id: source
  description: a lightweight analog to the association class 'has provider' slot,
    which is the string name, or the authoritative (i.e. database) namespace, designating
    the origin of the entity to which the slot belongs.
  display_name: source
- id: provided_by
  description: connects an association to the agent (person, organization or group)
    that provided it

  cardinality: multi
- id: has_attribute
  description: connects any entity to an attribute
  display_name: has attribute
  cardinality: multi
- id: relation
  description: The relation which describes an association between a subject and an
    object in a more granular manner. Usually this is a term from Relation Ontology,
    but it can be any edge CURIE.
  display_name: relation
- id: negated
  description: if set to true, then the association is negated i.e. is not true
  display_name: negated
- id: qualifiers
  description: connects an association to qualifiers that modify or qualify the meaning
    of that association
  display_name: qualifiers
  cardinality: multi
- id: publications
  description: connects an association to publications supporting the association
  display_name: publications
  cardinality: multi
- id: type
  description: rdf:type of biolink:Association should be fixed at rdf:Statement
  display_name: association_type
- id: category
  description: "Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized.\
    \ Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.\n * In a neo4j database\
    \ this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.\n * In an RDF database it should\
    \ be a biolink model class URI.\nThis field is multi-valued. It should include\
    \ values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh\
    \ would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`,\
    \ ...\nIn an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This\
    \ can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific\
    \ than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type\
    \ assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than\
    \ anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity,\
    \ biolink:NamedThing}"

- id: start_interbase_coordinate
  description: The position at which the subject genomic entity starts on the chromosome
    or other entity to which it is located on.
  display_name: start interbase coordinate
- id: end_interbase_coordinate
  description: The position at which the subject genomic entity ends on the chromosome
    or other entity to which it is located on.
  display_name: end interbase coordinate
- id: genome_build
  description: The version of the genome on which a feature is located. For example,
    GRCh38 for Homo sapiens.
  display_name: genome build
- id: strand
  description: The strand on which a feature is located. Has a value of '+' (sense
    strand or forward strand) or '-' (anti-sense strand or reverse strand).
  display_name: strand
- id: phase
  description: The phase for a coding sequence entity. For example, phase of a CDS
    as represented in a GFF3 with a value of 0, 1 or 2.
  display_name: phase
- id: subject
  description: connects an association to the subject of the association. For example,
    in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
  display_name: genomic sequence localization_subject
- id: object
  description: connects an association to the object of the association. For example,
    in a gene-to-phenotype association, the gene is subject and phenotype is object.
  display_name: genomic sequence localization_object
- id: predicate
  description: A high-level grouping for the relationship type. AKA minimal predicate.
    This is analogous to category for nodes.
  display_name: genomic sequence localization_predicate
