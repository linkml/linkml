    which is the string name, or the authoritative (i.e. database) namespace, designating
    the origin of the entity to which the slot belongs.

- id: relation
  description: The relation which describes an association between a subject and an
    object in a more granular manner. Usually this is a term from Relation Ontology,
    but it can be any edge CURIE.

  description: the subject gene in the association. If the relation is symmetric,
    subject vs object is arbitrary. We allow a gene product to stand as a proxy for
    the gene or vice versa.
