  description: a lightweight analog to the association class 'has provider' slot,
    which is the string name, or the authoritative (i.e. database) namespace, designating
    the origin of the entity to which the slot belongs.

  description: connects any entity to an attribute
  display_name: has attribute
  cardinality: multi
- id: relation
  description: The relation which describes an association between a subject and an
    object in a more granular manner. Usually this is a term from Relation Ontology,
    but it can be any edge CURIE.

- id: category
  description: "Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized.\
    \ Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class.\n * In a neo4j database\
    \ this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag.\n * In an RDF database it should\
    \ be a biolink model class URI.\nThis field is multi-valued. It should include\
    \ values for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh\
    \ would have category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`,\
    \ ...\nIn an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This\
    \ can be to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific\
    \ than something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type\
    \ assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than\
    \ anything in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity,\
    \ biolink:NamedThing}"
