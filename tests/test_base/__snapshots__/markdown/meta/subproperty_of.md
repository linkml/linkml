| **Examples:** | | Example(value='RO:HOM0000001', description='this is the RO term for "in homology relationship with", and used as a value of subproperty of this means that any ontological child (related to RO:HOM0000001 via an is_a relationship), is a valid value for the slot that declares this with the subproperty_of tag.  This differs from the \'values_from\' meta model component in that \'values_from\' requires the id of a value set (said another way, if an entire ontology had a curie/identifier that was the identifier for the entire ontology, then that identifier would be used in \'values_from.\')', object=None) |
