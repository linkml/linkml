# Subset: BasicSubset

An extension of MinimalSubset that avoids advanced constructs and can be implemented by a broad variety of tools.

This subset roughly corresponds to the union of most standard constructs used in relational datamodel modeling,
object oriented modeling, and simple JSON-style modeling, while avoiding more advanced constructs from these languages.

It is often possible to translate from a more expressive schema to a BasicSubset schema, through a schema derivation
process
