# Slot: abbreviation

An abbreviation for a unit is a short ASCII string that is used in place of the full name for the unit in  contexts where non-ASCII characters would be problematic, or where using the abbreviation will enhance  readability. When a power of a base unit needs to be expressed, such as squares this can be done using  abbreviations rather than symbols (source: qudt)
