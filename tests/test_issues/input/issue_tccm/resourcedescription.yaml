      ResourceDescription represents the shared characteristics common to both abstract and resource version
      descriptions. ResourceDescription is an abstract type and, as such, cannot be directly created. Resource
      descriptions are Changeable, meaning that they have identity and can be created, updated, and deleted.

      about:
        description: >-
          The (or a) definitive URI that represents the resource being described. Note that this is NOT the URI of the
          resource description in the TCCM or other format, but of the resource itself. As an example, the about URI
          for the Wine ontology would be “http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-owl-guide-2003 1209/wine#.” The NCI Thesaurus
          has, among others, the about URI of http://ncicb.nci.nih.gov/xml/owl/EVS/Thesaurus.owl#. HL7 uses ISO Object
          Identifiers (OIDs) to label resources so, from the HL7 perspective, the about URI of the NCI Thesaurus would
          be “urn:oid:2.16.840. 1.113883.3.26.1.1”
        range: ExternalURI
        required: true
      resourceID:
        description: >-
          A local identifier that uniquely names the resource within the context of the describedResourceType and
          implementing service. As an example, this might be “SCT” for the SNOMED-CT code system, “SCT-2010AA” for a
          SNOMED-CT code system version.
        range: LocalIdentifier
        required: true
      formalName:
        description: The formal or officially assigned name of this resource, if any.
        range: string
      keyword:
        description: Additional identifiers that are used to index and locate the resource.
        range: string
        multivalued: true
      resourceSynopsis:
        description: A textual summary of the resource - what it is, what it is for, etc.
        range: string
      additionalDocumentation:
        description: A reference to a document that provide additional information about the resource.
        range: PersistentURI
        multivalued: true
      rights:
        description: Copyright and IP information. Note that rights applies to the source resource, not the CTS2 rendering.
        range: string
      alternateID:
        description: >-
          An alternative identifier that uniquely names this resource in other environments as contexts.
          As an example, if a resource had both an ISO Object Identifier and a DNS name, the DNS name might be assigned
          as the entryID of the resource by one service while the ISO OID would be recorded as an alternateURI using
          the “urn:oid” prefix. Note that alternateIds can be added or removed during resource updates.

  SourceAndNotation:
    description: Format and notation that some or all the releases (versions) of this resource are published in
    slot_usage:
      sourceAndNotationDescription:
        description: >-
          A textual description of where the specified resource version was derived from. This parameter
          must be supplied if a reasonable PersistentURI for the source document is not available.
          range: string
      sourceDocument:
        description: >-
          A persistentURI that references the document from which the resource version was derived. This URI may be
          resolvable to a digital resource or may be the name of a book, publication, or other external document.
        range: PersistentURI
      sourceLanguage:
        description: >-
          The formal language, if any, that the source for the resource version is expressed in. Examples include
          Common Logic, OWL, OWL-DL, CLAML26, etc.
        range: OntologyLanguageReference
      sourceDocumentSyntax:
        description: >-
          The syntax of the source of the resource version, if known. Examples might include rdf/xml, Turtle,
          Manchester Syntax, CSV, etc.
        range: OntologySyntaxReference

  ResourceVersionDescription:
    is_a: ResourceDescription
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      Information about the source, format, release date, version identifier, etc. of a specific version of an
      abstract resource.
    slot_usage:
      documentURI:
        description:
          A URI that identifies the specific version, language, and notation of the about resource. This URI needs to
          be constructed in such a way that, if necessary, it will be possible to differentiate resource versions that
          were loaded from different document syntaxes. As an example, if an image of a wine ontology was loaded from
          a resource that was in Manchester Syntax, it should be given a different URI than the image loaded from the
          RDF/XML syntax. The reasoning behind this is, even in cases where different syntaxes are 100% compatible
          the transformation into the TCCM model may not be identical.
        range: DocumentURI
      sourceAndNotation:
        description: >-
          A description of where the (or a) source of the version may be found, what format and language it is
