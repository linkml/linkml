  his diagram identifies all of the value domains that are used within the TCCM service itself. Each reference has a
  domain, which frequently isn’t necessary to carry through to PSMs with strong type systems, a name that serves as a
  unique permissible value within the context of the domain, a uri that references the intended meaning of name, and an
  optional href that, if present, provides a link to a TCCM EntityDescription that provides definitions, descriptions,
  etc. of the meaning.

  The NameAndMeaningReference pattern represents, at the meta-level, one of the key purposes for a TCCM based service
  to establish lists of value domains (identified here by ReferenceType) from which sets of permissible values and
  meanings can be drawn.

  For each specific reference below we attempt to identify an ontology or value set from which the set of possible
  values could be drawn. We then state whether this set is mandatory, meaning that it must be used in a compliant
  TCCM implementation, recommended, meaning that, while not required, we anticipate that significant gains in
  interoperability would result were it used, or simply exemplar, meaning that the set carries examples of what
  might be used.

    description: >-
      A NameAndMeaningReference consists of a local identifier that references a unique meaning within the context of
      a given domain in a TCCM service instance and a globally unique URI that identifies the intended meaning of the
      identifier.
