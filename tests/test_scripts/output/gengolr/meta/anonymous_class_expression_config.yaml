- id: is_a
  description: specifies single-inheritance between classes or slots. While multiple
    inheritance is not allowed, mixins can be provided effectively providing the same
    thing. The semantics are the same when translated to formalisms that allow MI
    (e.g. RDFS/OWL). When translating to a SI framework (e.g. java classes, python
    classes) then is a is used. When translating a framework without polymorphism
    (e.g. json-schema, solr document schema) then is a and mixins are recursively
    unfolded
