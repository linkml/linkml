- id: string_serialization
  description: 'Used on a slot that stores the string serialization of the containing
    object. The syntax follows python formatted strings, with slot names enclosed
    in {}s. These are expanded using the values of those slots.

    We call the slot with the serialization the s-slot, the slots used in the {}s
    are v-slots. If both s-slots and v-slots are populated on an object then the value
    of the s-slot should correspond to the expansion.

    Implementations of frameworks may choose to use this property to either (a) PARSE:
    implement automated normalizations by parsing denormalized strings into complex
    objects (b) GENERARE: implement automated to_string labeling of complex objects

    For example, a Measurement class may have 3 fields: unit, value, and string_value.
    The string_value slot may have a string_serialization of {value}{unit} such that
    if unit=cm and value=2, the value of string_value shouldd be 2cm'

    thing. The semantics are the same when translated to formalisms that allow MI
    (e.g. RDFS/OWL). When translating to a SI framework (e.g. java classes, python
    classes) then is a is used. When translating a framework without polymorphism
    (e.g. json-schema, solr document schema) then is a and mixins are recursively
    unfolded

  description: Used to extend class or slot definitions. For example, if we have a
    core schema where a gene has two slots for identifier and symbol, and we have
    a specialized schema for my_organism where we wish to add a slot systematic_name,
    we can avoid subclassing by defining a class gene_my_organism, adding the slot
    to this class, and then adding an apply_to pointing to the gene class. The new
    slot will be 'injected into' the gene class.
