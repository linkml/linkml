- id: values_from
  description: 'The identifier of a "value set" -- a set of identifiers that form

    in that ''subproperty_of'' is intended to be a single ontology term while ''values_from''
    is the identifier of an entire value set.  Additionally, this is different than
    an enumeration in that in an enumeration, the values of the enumeration are listed
    directly in the model itself. Setting this property on a slot does not guarantee
    an expansion of the ontological hierarchy into an enumerated list of possible
    values in every serialization of the model.'

  cardinality: multi
- id: string_serialization
  description: 'Used on a slot that stores the string serialization of the containing
    object. The syntax follows python formatted strings, with slot names enclosed
    in {}s. These are expanded using the values of those slots.

    We call the slot with the serialization the s-slot, the slots used in the {}s
    are v-slots. If both s-slots and v-slots are populated on an object then the value
    of the s-slot should correspond to the expansion.

    Implementations of frameworks may choose to use this property to either (a) PARSE:
    implement automated normalizations by parsing denormalized strings into complex
    objects (b) GENERARE: implement automated to_string labeling of complex objects

    For example, a Measurement class may have 3 fields: unit, value, and string_value.
    The string_value slot may have a string_serialization of {value}{unit} such that
    if unit=cm and value=2, the value of string_value shouldd be 2cm'
