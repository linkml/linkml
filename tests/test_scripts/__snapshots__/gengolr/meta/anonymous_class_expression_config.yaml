  description: A primary parent class or slot from which inheritable metaslots are
    propagated from. While multiple inheritance is not allowed, mixins can be provided
    effectively providing the same thing. The semantics are the same when translated
    to formalisms that allow MI (e.g. RDFS/OWL). When translating to a SI framework
    (e.g. java classes, python classes) then is a is used. When translating a framework
    without polymorphism (e.g. json-schema, solr document schema) then is a and mixins
    are recursively unfolded
