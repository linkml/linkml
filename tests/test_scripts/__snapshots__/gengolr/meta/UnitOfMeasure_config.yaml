  description: 'An abbreviation for a unit is a short ASCII string that is used in
    place of the full name for the unit in  contexts where non-ASCII characters would
    be problematic, or where using the abbreviation will enhance  readability. When
    a power of a base unit needs to be expressed, such as squares this can be done
    using  abbreviations rather than symbols (source: qudt)'
