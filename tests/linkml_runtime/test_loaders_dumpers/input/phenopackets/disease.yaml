        description: Flag to indicate whether the disease was observed or not. Default is 'false', in other words the disease was observed. Therefore it is only required in cases to indicate that the disease was looked for, but found to be absent. More formally, this modifier indicates the logical negation of the OntologyClass used in the 'term' field. *CAUTION* It is imperative to check this field for correct interpretation of the disease!
