  description: rdf:type of biolink:Association should be fixed at rdf:Statement
  display_name: association_type
  cardinality: multi
- id: category
  description: Name of the high level ontology class in which this entity is categorized.
    Corresponds to the label for the biolink entity type class. In a neo4j database
    this MAY correspond to the neo4j label tag. In an RDF database it should be a
    biolink model class URI. This field is multi-valued. It should include values
    for ancestors of the biolink class; for example, a protein such as Shh would have
    category values `biolink:Protein`, `biolink:GeneProduct`, `biolink:MolecularEntity`.
    In an RDF database, nodes will typically have an rdf:type triples. This can be
    to the most specific biolink class, or potentially to a class more specific than
    something in biolink. For example, a sequence feature `f` may have a rdf:type
    assertion to a SO class such as TF_binding_site, which is more specific than anything
    in biolink. Here we would have categories {biolink:GenomicEntity, biolink:MolecularEntity,
    biolink:NamedThing}
