types:

  PersistentURI:
    typeof: URIorCurie
    description: >-
      A Universal Resource Identifier (URI) that persists across service instances. PersistentURIs have enduring
      reference and meaning.

  LocalURI:
    typeof: URIorCurie
    description: >-
      A URI or handle whose scope is local to the implementing service. LocalURI cannot be used as a permanent
      identifier in a message or a data record.

  ChangeSetURI:
    typeof: PersistentURI
    description: >-
      The unique identifier of a set of change instructions that can potentially transform the contents of a TCCM
      service instance from one state to another.

  DocumentURI:
    typeof: PersistentURI
    description: >-
      A reference to a “work” in the bibliographic sense. It is not necessary that a Document URI be directly or
      indirectly resolvable to a digital resource - it may simply be the name of a book, publication, or other
      abstraction.

  ExternalURI:
    typeof: PersistentURI
    description: >-
      A URI that names a unique resource. CTS2 implementations should never assume that ExternalURI is resolvable
      via an http: GET operation - ExternalURIs should always be passed as parameters to service implementations
      to get the sanctioned equivalent in a given service context.

  ServiceURI:
    typeof: LocalURI
    description: >-
      The URI or CURIE of a service implementation

  RenderingURI:
    typeof: LocalURI
    description: >-
      A URI or handle that is directly readable by a specific instance of a TCCM service implementation. RenderingURI
      must resolve to Changeable CTS2 element.

  DirectoryURI:
    typeof: LocalURI
    description: >-
      The unique name of a query that when executed results in a list of resources that, in the context of a given
      service, satisfy the query.
