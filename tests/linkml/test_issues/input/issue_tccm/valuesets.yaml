types:
  ValueSet:
    typeof: URIorCurie
    description: A URI that can be indirectly resolved to a set of entity descriptions

  ASSOCIATION:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      A formal “semantic” assertion about a named entity, in the form of subject, predicate, and object including any
      provenance, qualifiers, or internal BNODEs.

  BINDING_QUALIFIER:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      An assertion about the semantics of a concept domain / value set binding. This model element exists specifically
      to address section 2.4.2.23 of the HL7 SFM14, which needs a qualifier that indicates whether the binding is
      “overall,” “minimal,” or “maximum.”

      The TCCM specification does not formally define the semantics of the various possible BINDING_QUALIFIER elements:
      it is up to specific implementations and service clients to interpret the meaning of the specific binding
      qualifiers that may be represented in references of this type.

  CASE_SIGNIFICANCE:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      Identifies the significance of case in a term or designation.

  CODE_SYSTEM_CATEGORY:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      The general category of a code system (flat list, subject heading system, taxonomy, thesaurus, classification,
      terminology, description logic ontology, first order predicate logic, etc.) (same as
      KnowledgeRepresentationParadigm: OMV 5.8).

  CODE_SYSTEM:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      A collection of metadata about the provenance, use, and distribution of a code system or ontology.

  CODE_SYSTEM_VERSION:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      A collection of metadata about content and distribution format of a particular version or release of a code system.

  CONCEPT_DOMAIN:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      The description of the conceptual domain of a field in a message, column in a database, field on a form, etc.
      Equivalent to the ISO 11179-3 “Data Element Concept.”

  CONTEXT:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      External and environmental factors that serve to discriminate among multiple possible selections. While it is
      assumed that the specific contexts referenced by CONTEXT are represented by entity descriptions contained in
      some ontology or coding scheme, the CTS2 specification does not recommend any targets. Note, however, the TCCM
      context is intended to represent the notion of “jurisdictional domain” or “realm” as described in the HL7 CTS2 SFM .

  DESIGNATION_FIDELITY:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      Identifies how well a particular designation represents the intended meaning of the referenced entity. TCCM
      implementations may consider using the SKOS16 semantic relations to represent this relationship.

  DESIGNATION_TYPE:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      The particular form or type of a given designation: can be “short name,” “long name,” “abbreviation,” “eponym.”

  FORMALITY_LEVEL:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      The level of formality of an ontology (OMV 5.9).

  FORMAT:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      A particular way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file

  LANGUAGE:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      A spoken or written language intended for human consumption.

  MATCH_ALGORITHM:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      A predicate that determines whether an entity resource qualities for membership in a set based on supplied
      matching criteria.

  MAP:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      A set of rules that associate a set of entity references from one domain into those in another.

  MAP_CORRELATION:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      An assertion about the strength or significance of a specific rule in a Map.

  MAP_VERSION:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      The state of a Map at a given point in time.

  MODEL_ATTRIBUTE:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      An attribute defined in CTS2 information model.

  NAMESPACE:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      A reference to a conceptual space that groups identifiers to avoid conflict with items that have the same name but different meanings.

  ONTOLOGY_ENGINEERING_METHODOLOGY:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      Information about the ontology engineering methodology (OMV 5.4) (sic).

    description: >-
      A tool used to create the ontology (OMV 5.5).

  ONTOLOGY_DOMAIN:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      While the domain can refer to any topic ontology it is advised to use one of the established general purpose
      topic hierarchy like DMOZ or domain specific topic like ACM for the computer science domain. Only this way it can
      be ensured that meaningful information about the relation of the domains of two separate ontologies can be
      deduced (OMV 5.1 1)(sic).

  ONTOLOGY_LANGUAGE:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      Information about the language in which the ontology is implemented (OMV 5.7).

  ONTOLOGY_SYNTAX:

      Information about the syntax used by an ontology (OMV 5.6).

  ONTOLOGY_TASK:
    typeof: ValueSet
    description: >-
      Information about the task the ontology was intended to be used for (OMV 5.10).

  ONTOLOGY_TYPE:

      references.
