### Schema
#
# - name: brief description of the test case
# - linkml_rules: will be injected into the `rules` slot of a test class in a LinkML schema
# - json_schema: a YAML representation of an expected subset of the generated JSON Schema
# - data_cases: data instance validation tests. Must have a `data` field which will be validated
#               against the JSON schema. By default it is expected to be valid. If the case is
#               expected to be invalid, provide an `error_message` field which will be matched
#               against the validation error message.
