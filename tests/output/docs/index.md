**metamodel version:** 1.7.0

**version:** None


The metamodel for schemas defined using the Linked Data Modeling Language framework.

For more information on LinkML:

* [linkml.io](https://linkml.io) main website
* [specification](https://w3id.org/linkml/docs/specification/)

LinkML is self-describing. Every LinkML schema consists of elements
that instantiate classes in this metamodel.

Core metaclasses:

* [SchemaDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/SchemaDefinition)
* [ClassDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/ClassDefinition)
* [SlotDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/SlotDefinition)
* [TypeDefinition](https://w3id.org/linkml/TypeDefinition)

There are many subsets of *profiles* of the metamodel, for different purposes:

* [MinimalSubset](https://w3id.org/linkml/MinimalSubset)
* [BasicSubset](https://w3id.org/linkml/BasicSubset)

For canonical reference documentation on any metamodel construct,
refer to the official URI for each construct, e.g.

Note: this is different than 'subproperty_of' in that 'subproperty_of' is intended to be a single ontology term while 'values_from' is the identifier of an entire value set.  Additionally, this is different than an enumeration in that in an enumeration, the values of the enumeration are listed directly in the model itself. Setting this property on a slot does not guarantee an expansion of the ontological hierarchy into an enumerated list of possible values in every serialization of the model.
