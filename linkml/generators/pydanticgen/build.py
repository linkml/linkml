        Merge a build result with another.

        - Merges imports with :meth:`.Imports.__add__`
        - Extends (with simple deduplication) injected classes

        The top-level `merge` method is intended to just merge the "extra" parts of a result
        - ie. propagating the imports and injected classes up from 'lower' level results.
        It should *not* be used as a general "merge" method to eg. merge the results of two
        slot ranges into a Union of those ranges, etc. Either override this method (preserving
        the base behavior) or put that kind of merging logic into the generator.

            This returns a (shallow) copy of ``self``, so subclasses don't need to make additional copies.
