    - An instance of prov:Association provides additional descriptions about the binary
      prov:wasAssociatedWith relation from an prov:Activity to some prov:Agent that
      had some responsiblity for it. For example, prov:baking prov:wasAssociatedWith prov:baker;
      prov:qualifiedAssociation [ a prov:Association; prov:agent prov:baker; prov:foo prov:bar
      ].
