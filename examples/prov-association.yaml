    - An instance of prov:Association provides additional descriptions about the binary
      prov:wasAssociatedWith relation from an prov:Activity to some prov:Agent that
      had some responsibility for it. For example, prov:baking prov:wasAssociatedWith prov:baker;
      prov:qualifiedAssociation [ a prov:Association; prov:agent prov:baker; prov:foo prov:bar
      ].
    description: An activity association is an assignment of responsibility to an
      agent for an activity, indicating that the agent had a role in the activity.
      It further allows for a plan to be specified, which is the plan intended by
      the agent to achieve some goals in the context of this activity.
