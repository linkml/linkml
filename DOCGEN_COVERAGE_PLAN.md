# Documentation Coverage Improvement - Implementation Plan

This document tracks the work in progress for improving gen-doc coverage of LinkML metamodel properties.

## Issue

- **Issue**: #3004
- **Goal**: Increase property coverage from ~16-35% to 100%
- **Approach**: Progressive disclosure - only show properties that are set

## Current Status

**Phase**: Phase 2 Complete

- ✅ Phase 1: Common metadata properties (completed)
- ✅ Phase 2: Core element-specific properties (completed)
- ⏳ Phase 3: Expressions & Logic (pending)
- ⏳ Phase 4: Advanced Features (pending)

See the PR description for the complete implementation plan organized into 4 phases.

## Quick Reference

### Current Coverage
- ClassDefinition: 35% (25 of 72 properties)
- SlotDefinition: 17% (20 of 117 properties)
- EnumDefinition: 18% (12 of 65 properties)
- TypeDefinition: 16% (10 of 61 properties)

### Target Coverage
- **100%** of explicitly set properties visible in documentation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
Common metadata enhancements (~10-15 properties)

### Phase 2: Core Properties (Weeks 3-4)
Element-specific essentials (~20-30 properties)

### Phase 3: Expressions & Logic (Weeks 5-6)
Validation expressions (~15-20 properties)

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 7-8)
Complete coverage (remaining ~40-50 properties)

## Note

This file will be removed once implementation is complete and can be tracked via commits.
