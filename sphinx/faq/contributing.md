## How do I stay involved?

We have a slack channel for the core team and adopted of bleeding edge new features - just let us know via a GitHub issue if you would like an invite!

## How do I register my schema?

You can make a GitHub Pull Request (PR) on the main [linkml-registry](https://linkml.io/linkml-registry/home/) metadata file, which is here:

https://github.com/linkml/linkml-registry/blob/main/models.yaml

If you are not familiar with the process of making PRs via the GitHub interface, you may find the [guide to registering OBO ontologies](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-registry/blob/main/models.yaml) useful (of course, LinkML schemas are not OBO ontologies, but the process is analogous.
